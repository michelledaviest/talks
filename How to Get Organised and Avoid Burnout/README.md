# Note: Background and Intended Audience

Over the years, I would occasionally get questions from friends or people I work with about the processes I have built over the years to stay organized. I would make presentations that answered frequently asked questions and would give the person who asked me these questions a copy of the presentation. It was a way to avoid fatigue of answering the same question repeatedly and make sure my answers didn't vary from person to person depending on how sociable I felt when asked such a question. <br />

In 2020, a friend of mine invited me to speak at a freshman induction talk about organization and I finally decided to consolidate everything I knew on the topic. The resulting presentation is called "organize-your-life-and-dont-burnout" and the supporting files in this repo are answers to some other questions I would frequently get.  <br />

None of this advice is revolutionary and it's a bit odd to talk about organization when I'm 20 and not out of college yet. I hope you find something useful that helps you stay more organized but definitely take this advice with a grain of salt and seek out other perspectives. Feel free to email me if you'd like to add something!
