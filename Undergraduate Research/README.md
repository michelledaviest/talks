# Note: Intended Audience
This talk is given to Indian students from disconnected undergrad programs who have never considered doing research, or who are starting to think about pursuing research. It is very introductory. If you have a lot of research experience or are from an undergrad program that had some amount of emphasis on research, you might find a lot of the advice redundant.
